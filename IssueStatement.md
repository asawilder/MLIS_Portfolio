# Issue Statement

## Software obsolescence challenges the preservation of and access to born-digital records. New developments in emulation technology are beginning to offer at-scale solutions to these challenges.  However, with these solutions come new legal, ethical and practical concerns. In response, archivists must develop more standardized descriptive practices, and advocate for the creation of a national registry and licensing body for obsolete software.
