<h1>Issue Statement</h1>

<p>

<h1 style="font-family:garamond;">Software obsolescence poses a major threat to the preservation of born-digital records. New advancements in emulation technology are beginning to offer at-scale solutions to this problem.  However, with these solutions come new legal, ethical and practical concerns. In response, I advocate for the creation of a national registry and licensing body for obsolete software and the development of more standardized descriptive practices.</h1>
