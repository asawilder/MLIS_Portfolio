# Issue Statement
*** 


## Software obsolescence poses a major threat to the preservation of born-digital records. New advancements in emulation technology are beginning to offer at-scale solutions to this problem.  However, with these solutions come new legal and ethical concerns. I advocate for the creation of a national registry and licensing body for obsolete software and more standardized description practices.
